# SiSy Demo Script

Sisy is a routine management app inspired by the **"Getting Things Done"** methodology and the 4 Laws of Behavior Change from the book **"Atomic Habits"**.

On the minimalist Present Page, the user is guided to focus on the current task. Swipe right to complete a task, or swipe left to reschedule it. Click the task to view the details or add a comment.

On the Routine Page, Routine items can be set to auto-complete, meaning they will be completed automatically when the time comes, they are also displayed in a lighter color to let the user focus on the important tasks.

There is a short cut to ask Sisy to refine the routine item. Sisy will make suggestions based on the user's profile and the routine item itself. 

On the Me Page, a flexible user profile is maintained in key-value pairs. The Profile and Routine pages contain all the data that SiSy knows about the user.

SiSy is built for the user who values their time and energy, it provides the structure to iterate, improve, and eventually, succeed.
