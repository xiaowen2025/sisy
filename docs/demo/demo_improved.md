# SiSy Demo Script

## 1. Introduction
**SiSy** is a routine management app inspired by the **"Getting Things Done"** methodology and the **4 Laws of Behavior Change** from the book *"Atomic Habits"*.

## 2. Onboarding: Profile & Routine
Start by sharing your profile or existing routine. You can do this via the app's **Profile** and **Routine** pages, or simply by describing them in the chat.

### Example Profile Input
> "I'm 35, software engineer. I love reading & hiking. I have an iron deficiency."

### Example Routine Input
> "I wake up at 7am. Around 7:30 I go for a 30 min jog. Shower at 8:15. Breakfast at 8:45, usually oatmeal. Start work at 9:30."

## 3. The Present Page (Focus Mode)
On the minimalist **Present Page**, the user is guided to focus on the current task.
- **Swipe Right**: Complete a task.
- **Swipe Left**: Reschedule a task.
- **Tap**: View details or add a comment.

## 4. The Routine Page (Management)
On the **Routine Page**, AI-updated items are highlighted for review.

- **Focus**: Less critical items are displayed in a lighter color to help the user focus on important tasks.
- **AI Refinement**: Use the shortcut to ask SiSy to refine a routine item. SiSy will make personalized suggestions to make the item more actionable.
