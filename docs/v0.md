> For the long-term vision and adaptive loop, see `sisy/docs/vision.md`.

## 0. MVP goal, scope, and non-goals

- **MVP goal:** Keep the user oriented on a viable **next step** with minimal interaction, even when the day changes.
- **MVP scope (must ship):**
  - Omni-Chat input available from every screen
  - Minimalist Home “now/next” view
  - Routine template storage/editing (basic)
  - Lightweight profile (“Me”) view for what the system knows
  - Simple reschedule + completion signals
- **Non-goals (MVP):**
  - Full calendar replacement / complex scheduling engine
  - Social / collaboration
  - Deep health analytics (medical-grade)

## 1. Brand identity & UX principles (MVP constraints)

- **Design language:** **Extreme Minimalism**
- **Interaction mood:** Like an old friend—present when needed, invisible when you are focused.
- **MVP UX constraints:**
  - **One-primary-action** per screen (everything else is secondary or hidden)
  - **No setup wall:** user can start with empty profile + empty routine
  - **Speed:** most interactions should be doable in <10 seconds

## 2. Information architecture

- **Bottom navigation:** Home / Routine / Me
- **Omni-Chat:** persistent input anchored above the nav, available everywhere

## 3. Functional modules (MVP requirements)

### The "Omni-Chat" Layer

SiSy is an always-available companion.

- **Persistent input (REQ-CHAT-1):** A chat input field is anchored above the navigation bar on **every screen** (Home, Routine, Me).
    
- **Context awareness (REQ-CHAT-2):** The input knows which tab is active and includes that context in the message payload.
        
- **Smart Drawer (REQ-CHAT-3):** Tapping the input expands a drawer over current content showing recent chat history, without navigating away.
- **Message types (REQ-CHAT-4):** Support at least:
  - **State update:** “I’m exhausted”, “I have 20 minutes”
  - **Intent:** “Help me plan today”, “Move my next task”
  - **Capture:** “Remind me to …”, “I need to …”

**Acceptance criteria**
- **AC-CHAT-1:** Input is visible on Home/Routine/Me and remains usable after switching tabs.
- **AC-CHAT-2:** Opening/closing the drawer does not reset the underlying screen state.

### The Navigation Anchor

A minimalist bottom navigation bar allows instant switching between the three core dimensions of the user's life.

- **Layout (REQ-NAV-1):** Three icon-based buttons located at the very bottom of the screen.
    
    1. **Home:** The minimalist page about the current or next Task.
        
    2. **Routine:** The page about the default routine template.
        
    3. **Me:** The page about the user profile, SiSy's learning about the user
        
- **Behavior (REQ-NAV-2):** Single tap to switch. Double-tap on the active tab to scroll to the top (or refresh context).

**Acceptance criteria**
- **AC-NAV-1:** Switching tabs is instant and does not lose the current “now/next” task state.
- **AC-NAV-2:** Double-tap on active tab scrolls to top (or triggers refresh) consistently.

### 3.1 Home: Minimalist Command Center

- **Primary view (REQ-HOME-1):** Full screen with only **one line of text**: **Current/Next task + time**.
- **Empty state (REQ-HOME-2):** If no tasks exist, show one-line prompt (e.g., “What’s next?”) and focus the Omni-Chat input on tap.

- **Core Actions:**
    
    - **Time tweak (REQ-HOME-3):** Tap + slide to postpone/pull a task time.
      - After adjustment, SiSy confirms the new time.
      - Optionally asks for a reason (“Want to tell me why?”) depending on user preference.
        
    - **Completion feedback (REQ-HOME-4):** Mark task as done with one gesture/tap.
      - SiSy may ask a lightweight follow-up (“How do you feel?”) depending on user preference and task type.
    - **Gesture mapping (REQ-HOME-5):** The MVP must define and implement a consistent, discoverable gesture set:
      - **Swipe right:** complete current task
      - **Swipe left:** open reschedule (time tweak) interaction
      - **Tap:** open details (optional) or focus Omni-Chat (fallback)

**Acceptance criteria**
- **AC-HOME-1:** Home never shows more than one primary line of content (excluding the persistent chat input).
- **AC-HOME-2:** Rescheduling and completion require no more than one confirmation step.
- **AC-HOME-3:** Gestures are consistent across sessions and have a lightweight hint the first time (or via a help affordance).
        

### 3.2 "Me" Interface

- **Function (REQ-ME-1):** Visualize the user profile as simple key-value sections (e.g., Basics / Nutrition / Fitness / Rest).
- **Long values (REQ-ME-2):** Values may be long strings and arbitrary text; UI must handle truncation + expand.

- **Purpose:** Let users see how SiSy understands them.

**Acceptance criteria**
- **AC-ME-1:** User can view all stored fields without layout breaking.
- **AC-ME-2:** User can edit or delete a field (even if “AI learned”) in MVP.
    

### 3.3 "Routine" Interface

- **Function (REQ-ROUTINE-1):** Store the user’s Routine Template (the default day structure).
    
- **Linkage (REQ-ROUTINE-2):** Routine is the “master template” referenced when generating today’s tasks.
- **Editing (REQ-ROUTINE-3):** User can add/edit/remove routine items (at minimum: title + optional time window).
- **Minimum editor UI (REQ-ROUTINE-4):** The Routine screen must support, at minimum:
  - A list of routine items
  - “Add” action
  - Inline edit of title and optional time window
  - Delete action (with one-step confirmation)

**Acceptance criteria**
- **AC-ROUTINE-1:** Routine edits persist and affect newly generated plans.
- **AC-ROUTINE-2:** Routine can be empty; app remains usable.
- **AC-ROUTINE-3:** A user can add → edit → delete a routine item in under 30 seconds without using Omni-Chat.
    

## 4. Core MVP flows (minimum)

- **Flow A — Start from nothing:** open app → Home empty state → user types intent in Omni-Chat → system creates a Task (source=`chat`) → Home shows it as the next step.
- **Flow B — Disruption:** user types a state update (“I’m exhausted”) → system suggests a revised next step.
- **Flow C — Reschedule:** user slides time tweak on Home → confirm → optional reason capture.
- **Flow D — Completion:** user marks done → optional feeling check → next task appears.
- **Flow E — Routine edit:** user edits Routine template → future plans reference it.
- **Flow F — Profile transparency:** user opens Me → sees learned fields → edits/deletes one.

## 5. Minimal data model & events (MVP)

- **Task**
  - `id`, `title`, `scheduled_time` (optional), `status` (todo/done), `source` (routine/chat/system)
- **RoutineItem**
  - `id`, `title`, `time_window` (optional)
- **ProfileField**
  - `key`, `value`, `source` (user/learned), `updated_at`
- **Events to capture**
  - `task_completed`, `task_rescheduled`, `state_reported`, `profile_field_edited`

## 6. MVP “done” checklist

- User can complete **Flows A–F** end-to-end without errors.
- Home stays minimalist (one primary line) while still supporting reschedule + done.
- Routine and profile are optional (empty is valid).

## 7. API endpoints (MVP)
